          Diversification is a technique that reduces risk by allocating
          investments among various financial instruments, industries and
          other categories. It aims to maximize return by investing in
          different areas that should each react differently to changes in
          market conditions.

          A stock is considered risky when it does not have a lot of earnings
          history. This is important because it proves to investors that the
          company has a history of generating cash for the business. Another
          aspect that makes a stock risky is the lack of time on the market.
          If the stock has recently gone public, it will be more volatile due
          to investors not knowing how the stock should be valued.
