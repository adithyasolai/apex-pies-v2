  "age": "The younger an investor is, the riskier the portfolio should be. The rationale behind this logic is because these investors have more time until they need to cash out their investments. There are always ups and downs when investing, and having higher risk generally guarantees higher returns in the long run.",
  "risk-tolerance": "The amount of risk an investor takes on depends on several factors. The factors investors should take into account include: their existing debt, savings account balance, and net worth. For example: An investor with low debt combined with high savings account balance and net worth would have a higher risk tolerance.",
  "sector-of-interest": "Each sector can provide vastly different returns and have varying levels of risk. Tech and Energy are considered to be high-return, high-risk sectors. Inversely, Banking and Healthcare tend to be less riskier sectors, meaning lower returns."
